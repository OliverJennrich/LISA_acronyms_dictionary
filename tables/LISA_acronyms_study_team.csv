MCU,Mechanism Control Unit,"[IDS doc] The Mechanism Control Unit (MCU) is an avionics unit dedicated to the control of the mechanisms mounted on the optical bench. These mechanisms are: the PAAM, the FSUA and the BAM. The unit shall interface with the mechanisms to provide power and command and control functions. It is expected that the MCU interfaces to the ICC (or to the OBC, if no ICC appears in the final system design)."

[IDS doc] The transmit laser beam steering angle needs to be adjusted at least once every few minutes with an accuracy of ~10 nrad to ensure the beam is received by the distant spacecraft. This will be done through the use of the PAAM in a step-and-stare mode of operation."

PT,Pilot Tone,The pilot tone (e.g. a 75 MHz sinusoidal tone) is added to beatnote signals within the phasemeter analog front end. Its purpose is to measure sampling aperture ji�ers within the ADCs which are later used to correct these jitt�ers. [Timing architecture TN]
QPD,Quadrant Photo Detector,
QPR,Quadrant Photo-Receiver(s),"Each QPR features three main components: 1) an InGaAs quadrant photodiode (QPD) with four segments, aiming to convert the optical signal into a photocurrent; 
2) a front-end electronics (FEE) with the main goal of amplifying each QPD segment�s photocurrent and converting it into voltage; 
3) a mechanical enclosure aiming to provide precise and stable positioning of each QPD with the optical beam, to assure the electromagnetic compatibility of the QPR and to assembly the QPD and the FEE in the limited volume allocated on the OB."
