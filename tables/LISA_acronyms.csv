Acronym,Translation,Description
A/D,Analog-To-Digital Converter,"In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal."
AC,Alternating Current,Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction.
ACS,Attitude Control System,
ADC,Analog-To-Digital Converter,"In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal."
ADS,Airbus Deutschland (Friedrichshafen),Airbus is a European multinational aerospace corporation.
AEI,Albert Einstein Institute,The Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) is the largest research institute in the world specializing in general relativity and beyond. The institute is located in Potsdam and in Hannover where it closely collaborates with the Leibniz University Hannover.
