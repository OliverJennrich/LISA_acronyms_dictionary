Acronym,Translation,Description
MRD,Mission Requirement Document,The Mission Requirements Document (MRD) stems from the Science Requirements document [SciRD] and it contains the mission requirements considered necessary to achieve the science goals.
AC,Alternating Current,Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction.
A/D,Analog-To-Digital Converter,"In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal."
ADC,Analog-To-Digital Converter,"In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal."
ADS,Airbus Deutschland (Friedrichshafen),Airbus is a European multinational aerospace corporation.
AEI,Albert Einstein Institute,The Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) is the largest research institute in the world specializing in general relativity and beyond. The institute is located in Potsdam and in Hannover where it closely collaborates with the Leibniz University Hannover.
AGN,Active Galactic Nuclei,An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that has a much-higher-than-normal luminosity over at least some portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by stars.
