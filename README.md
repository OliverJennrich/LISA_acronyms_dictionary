# LISA Acronym Dictionary

Welcome to the LISA Acronym Dictionary. I created this out of frustration about the many acronyms used in this project. The screenshot below shows how the GUI looks like on a MacOSX, I don't know how it looks on a different OS, but happy for feedback.

To run the GUI you simply clone this repository and run the `acronym_gui.py` either outside or inside of Python. You should be able to type your acronym in the input field and hit enter (or use the search button). If you want to add more acronyms to the list edit the [LISA_acronyms.csv](LISA_acronyms.csv) file (I recommend in Excel), if possible also adding a short description.
